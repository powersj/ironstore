# TODO

Near term TODO for me to go through.

## Config

* Allow specifying what interface to listen on in server and CLI
* Verify file logging

## Server

* Way to keep track of metrics
  * Number of databases
  * Number of keys per database
  * Number of connections made
  * Number of successful commands
  * Number of failed commands
